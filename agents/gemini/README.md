# Gemini Agent - A2A Integration
This directory contains the Gemini agent, designed to integrate with the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) coordination system.

## Purpose
The Gemini agent provides advanced code generation, refactoring, and analysis capabilities, accessible through the unified A2A protocol. It works in tandem with other specialized agents in the ecosystem.

## Key Components
- `agent.py`: The main entry point and logic for the agent wrapper. It translates A2A tasks into requests for the Gemini API.
- `a2a-config.json`: Configuration file that defines the agent's name, capabilities, and communication settings.
- `pyproject.toml`: Python project dependencies.
